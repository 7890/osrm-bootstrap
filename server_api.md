# Server API

(This is a copy of https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-backend/wiki/Server-api)

The HTTP interface provided by `osrm-routed` (partially) implements _HTTP 1.1_ and serves queries much like normal web servers do.

The general structure of all queries looks like this:

```
http://{server address}/{service}?{parameter}={value}
```
Example:

```
http://127.0.0.1:5000/nearest?loc=52.4224,13.333086
```

The response is returned as JSON object by default. If you call from within Javascript and want to specify a callback function that should be called use the `jsonp={callback name}` parameter.

Each response has the following general structure:

```JSON
{
  "status": 200,
  "status_message": "Message text",
  .....
}
```

* `status` the status code. 200 means successful, 207 means no route was found.
* `status_message` (optional) can either be `Found route between points` or `Cannot find route between points`

## Available Services

Each service is implemented as a plugin for OSRM. Currently the following services are available:

| Service     |           Description                                     |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `viaroute`  | shortest path between given coordinates                   |
| `nearest`   | returns the nearest street segment for a given coordinate |
| `table`     | computes distance tables for given coordinates            |
| `match`     | matches given coordinates to the road network             |
| `trip`      | Compute the shortest round trip between given coordinates |


## Service `nearest`

### Query

```
http://{server}/nearest?loc={lat,lon}
```

|Parameter|Description|
|---------|-----------|
|loc|Location of the node as latitude longitude pair separated by a comma|

### Response

* `name` Name of the street the coordinate snapped to
* `mapped_coordinate` Array that contains the `[lat, lon]` pair of the snapped coordinate

### Example

Query
```
http://router.project-osrm.org/nearest?loc=52.4224,13.333086
```

Response:
```JSON
{
    "status": 200,

        52.42259,
        13.33383
    ],

}
```

## Service `viaroute`

This service provides shortest path queries with multiple via locations. It supports the computation of alternative paths as well as giving turn instructions.

### Query

```
http://{server}/viaroute?loc={lat,lon}&loc={lat,lon}<&loc={lat,lon} ...>
```

## Service `table`

This computes distance tables for the given via points. Please note that the distance in this case is the _travel time_ which is the default metric used by OSRM.
If only `loc` parameter is used, all pair-wise distances are computed.
If `dst` and `src` parameters are used instead, only pairs between scr/dst are computed.

### Query

```
http://{server}/table?loc={lat,lon}&loc={lat,lon}<&loc={lat,lon} ...>
```

|dst         |lat,lon                   |Location of the via point for rectangular matrix              |

### Response

* `distance_table` array of arrays that stores the matrix in row-major order. `distance_table[i][j]` gives the travel time from
  the i-th via to the j-th via point. Values are given in 10th of a second.
* `destination_coordinates` array of arrays that contains the `[lat, lon]` pair of the snapped coordinate
* `source_coordinates` array of arrays that contains the `[lat, lon]` pair of the snapped coordinate

### Example

With `loc`:
```
http://router.project-osrm.org/table?loc=52.554070,13.160621&loc=52.431272,13.720654&loc=52.554070,13.720654&loc=52.554070,13.160621

## Service `match`

Map matching matches given GPS points to the road network in the most plausible way. Currently the algorithm
works best with trace data that has a sample resolution of 5-10 samples/min.
Please note the request might result multiple sub-traces. Large jumps in the timestamps (>60s) or improbable transitions lead to trace splits if a complete matching could not be found.
The algorithm might not be able to match all points. Outliers are removed if they can not be matched successfully. The ```indices``` array contains the indices of the input location that could be matched.

### Query

```

### Response

* `matchings` array containing an object for each partial sub-matching of the trace.
  * `matched_points` coordinates of the points snapped to the road network in `[lat, lon]`
  * `indices` array that gives the indices of the matched coordinates in the original trace
  * `geometry` geometry of the matched trace in the road network. If `compression` is `true` (the default), the geometry is compressed as [polyline](http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/utilities/polylinealgorithm.html), but with 6 decimals. You can use the `npm` module [polyline](https://www.npmjs.com/package/polyline) to decompress it
  * `confidence` value between 0 and 1, where 1 is very confident. Please note that the correctness of this value depends highly on the assumptions about the sample rate mentioned above.
  * `instructions` see `route_instructions` of the `viaroute` service.
  * `hint_data` input for the `hint` and `checksum` parameter. This can be used to enable umambigious coordinate snapping when passed to services like `viaroute` and `trip`.

## Service `trip`

The trip plugin solves the famous Traveling Salesman Problem using a greedy heuristic (farest-insertion algorithm).
The returned path does not have to be the shortest path, as TSP is NP-hard it is only an approximation.
Note that if the input coordinates can not be joined by a single trip (e.g. the coordinates are on several disconnecte islands)
multiple trips for each connected component are returned.

### Query

```
http://{server}/trip?loc={lat,lon}&loc={lat,lon}<&loc={lat,lon} ...>
```

For all supported parameters see the `viaroute` plugin. `trip` does not support computing alternatives.

### Response

* `trips` array containing an object for each trip.
  * Object that models the reponse of `viaroute`. Additional members:
    * `permutation`: array of intergers. `permuation[i]` gives the position in the trip of the i-th input coordinate.

# HTTP Pipelining

As noted at the top of this page, OSRM only partially implements _HTTP 1.1_. Notably absent is support for [_pipelining_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_pipelining), which allows multiple requests to be served over a single socket. [OSRM Issue #531](/Project-OSRM/osrm-backend/issues/531) has some documented workarounds.
